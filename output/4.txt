Load shifting can be done manually or automatically, which requires smart metering and smart appliances, and can be also combined with battery storage to further increase self-consumption [87]. It is estimated that shifting these loads from peak times to other periods can reduce peak generation needs in the EU by about 10% [693]. On the other hand, energy storage helps store the surplus onsite renewable generation in a period of low demand for its use when energy demand is high and renewable production is low. The size of the elec - trical battery storage should be carefully selected as both the degree of self-consumption achieved and the total investment cost are signifi - cantly affected by the total battery capacity [87], and small sizes in - crease the system stress, reducing the battery lifetime [694]. In general, a larger battery capacity will increase the self-consumption but also the associated battery costs. It should be considered that the profit of bat - teries (which only store, do not produce, energy) comes from the dif - ference in selling and buying the electricity, so a balance is required between consumption, generation and storage capacity [87]. Another important factor to consider when selecting the battery ’ s size is the specific application requirements, that is, if it is only necessary to “ absorb ” some of the daily peaks of generation/demand, or longer storage periods are required (i.e., in more isolated cases). For residential solar systems, hydrogen, solid-state battery storage, or a combination of both, are being proposed by most investigators as the most suitable options for electricity storage [695 – 697]. Power-to-heat systems such as hot water boilers or HPs, which convert excess electricity into thermal energy, could also be used but it does not seem an interesting alternative for electricity conversion and storage due to the low efficiency defined by the Carnot cycle. Batteries have high conversion efficiencies but they also self-discharge, at a higher or lower extent depending on the battery technology, so they are more appro - priate for balancing daily fluctuations [698]. One of the main drawbacks of battery storage is cost, which ranges from less than one hundred to several hundred USD per kWh of storage capacity [699,700]. The most suitable technologies for residential applications are: lead-acid, lith - ium-ion (Li-ion), sodium-sulphur (NaS), nickel-cadmium (NiCd) and nickel metal hydride (NiMH) [701]. Conversely, hydrogen conversion has much lower round-trip efficiency (around 45% [695]). They are more suitable for seasonal energy storage using high-pressure tanks and reconverted to electricity with a fuel cell. The rate of self-discharge is close to zero in this case [698]. Furthermore, in recent years, battery costs have decreased signifi - cantly, thanks to technological development and economies of scale. The cost of Li-ion batteries, for example, decreased by 73% between 2010 and 2016, and an additional reduction of ~60% is projected by 2030 [700]. If instead of using individual decentralized energy storage systems at a household level, distributed systems are adopted on a neighbourhood or community basis, the cost per kWh is expected to decrease, while allowing the integration of higher volumes of distrib - uted renewable energy [4]. It is estimated that with DSM and/or decentralized energy storage, the self-consumption rate of an average Central European household with a PV system can be around 65 – 75% [4]. However, without these flexibility measures, the self-consumption rate is reduced to about 30% (see Fig. 60), and the excess of elec - tricity injected into the grid might create new challenges for the grid operation [4]. Therefore, flexibility measures appear essential to ach - ieve a successful integration of RES in the energy system. 6. System-level assessments and carbon mitigation potential The previous sections of this review introduced numerous innovative PV-T technologies which can displace conventional primary energy use (i.e., burning fossil fuels) for meeting the modern demand for both electrical and thermal energy. PV-T technologies, therefore, have a clear potential to represent part of the solution in achieving the Paris agree - ment aim of holding the global average temperature to 2 ◦ C above pre- industrial levels. The Paris agreement sets no specific technological pathway to achieve this goal, just broad carbon dioxide equivalent emissions targets based on pre-industrial levels [702]. Although 2020 – 2021 saw a temporary reduction in global carbon emissions resulting from the reduced economic activity due to COVID- 19, it is expected that global emissions will rebound to exceed 2019 levels [702]. Thus, reducing total annual global greenhouse gas emis - sions to 32 GtCO 2 /year by 2030 (to achieve the temperature limit of < 2 ◦ C above pre-industrial levels by 2100) continues to represent a difficult challenge [703,704]. Renewable technologies — including perhaps PV-T technologies — are expected to be at the core of this transition, but sig - nificant step-changes in technology, policy and adoption rates are still needed to accelerate clean energy growth [705]. Investment policies in renewable technologies for non-residential sectors (i.e., transport, in - dustrial) should be prioritized [706]. Importantly, about 65% of total global emissions are related directly or indirectly to household con - sumption [707], and thus policies are needed to encourage investment and adoption of solar technologies (including emerging technologies, such as PV-T collectors). Although the authors recognize that PV-T technologies account for only a small part of the energy share today, this section aims to estimate how much of a role PV-T technologies could play in this grand challenge. The motivation for this is that PV-T technologies can be utilized in both residential and non-residential sectors and have the potential, along with more traditional PV and ST technologies, to harness the enormous solar resource to make continuous improvements in embodied emissions [708]. The large projected growth of solar technologies is due to massive cost reductions that have been achieved over the past decades in PV technologies. In many places around the world, PV technologies are now more cost-effective than conventional electricity generators, particu - larly if any cost is associated with carbon emissions, since solar tech - nologies have a much lower carbon intensity per kWh of energy generated [709]. As an example of the potential impact of solar energy technologies, the IEA Energy Technologies Perspectives report for 2020 included both a “ sustainable development scenario ” and a “ faster innovation case ” , both of which rapidly ramp up the use of solar tech - nologies to achieve (or exceed) the Paris agreement target. This report analyses over 800 technology options to see which has the biggest impact on emissions mitigation [702]. Some key relevant comments in this report are that “ spreading the use of electricity into more parts of the economy is the single largest contributor to reaching net-zero emissions ” and, as part of that, “ renewable technologies need to supply the energy needed for heating, cooking and other appliances in buildings ” . In addition, the IEA report ’ s “ faster innovation case ” essentially requires new technologies to be deployed (e.g., PV-T technologies) by rapidly progressing new Fig. 60. Schematic outline of daily electricity demand (A + C), PV/PV-T electrical generation (B + C) and absolute self-consumption (C) in a building with an on-site PV/PV-T collector. It also indicates the function of the two main options (load shifting and energy storage) for increasing self-consumption [87]. M. Herrando et al.
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 55 technologies up the TRL scale [702]. Historically, solar technologies have focussed on performance and cost improvements [710], while carbon emission mitigation potential may eventually become one of the main driving goals in future renew - able energy developments [704]. Using carbon emission mitigation potential as a more holistic objective would force solar technologies to consider their whole life cycle, including: manufacturing, trans - portation, use phase, and end-of-life recycling. Although much more complex, this perspective would provide a bigger picture view of their overall benefit to society [546]. As an example, Fig. 61 shows the carbon intensity of the displaced energy supply mix as a function of solar irra - diation for characteristic Chinese-made crystalline PV panels. PV-T collectors are expected to have a higher mitigation potential than standalone PV panels [518,575], which could result in even more CO 2 emission savings compared to traditional PV panels. These modules consume 870 gCO 2 /kWh during their manufacture (e.g., embodied emissions) and, as shown in Fig. 61, their overall greenhouse gas emission mitigation potential is higher in high irradiation locations (e. g., higher in Australia compared to the UK) [711]. It can be observed that countries with relatively low-carbon intensity energy systems and relatively low solar resources (e.g., Norway and France), may only see a marginal carbon emissions mitigation potential from installing PV sys - tems. However, for locations with relatively high-carbon intensity and high solar resources (e.g., Australia, and India), PV installations can have a large impact. In either case, PV-T technologies can potentially ‘boost ’ the carbon mitigation potential (depending on their lifecycle emissions) since they can harvest more useful energy per unit than PV panels alone. When considering the carbon mitigation potential of solar PV and ST technologies independently, recent global studies [710,712,713] have found that performance depends on climate factors such as the direct normal incident irradiance (DNI), global horizontal irradiance (GHI), and ambient temperature. Fig. 62 shows a global map wherein the ‘optimal solar mix ’ was reported between ST collectors and PV panels for the same application [710]. For this study, it was assumed that a given rooftop has a fixed amount of space and that this space could be filled with a mixture of ST and PV collectors (PV-T technologies were not considered). It was found that ST collectors outperform PV panels in high solar irradiance, high-temperature locations (i.e., the ‘red ’ loca - tions on the map), while PV panels should be used to fill the rooftop in low solar irradiance locations (i.e., the ‘yellow ’ locations on the map). The study noted that it is still unclear which technology should be selected in ‘medium ’ solar irradiance locations, or when PV-T technol - ogies should play a role. What is clear is that many variables lead to the whole lifecycle emission mitigation potential of solar technologies, with the local solar resource and the existing energy mix being two of the most important factors. 6.1. Carbon emissions and PV-T technology To achieve the global warming temperature limit of 2 ◦ C above pre- industrial levels, many countries have set targets, pathways and action plans complemented by a wide variety of commitments and regulations [714]. Based upon these plans, countries have been grouped based on their nationally determined contribution (NDC) ambitions and climate-resilient pathways. These groupings have enabled forecasters to produce scenario estimates which vary from low to very high changes in the trajectory towards carbon mitigations [715]. Since these scenarios do not include PV-T technologies, they can be used as reference cases. One reference case that can be used in the business-as-usual perspective case, which includes the government ’ s current policies, plans, and NDC ’ s commitments, in which global emissions will peak at 35 GtCO 2 /year in 2050 [716]. However, in this work, we will build upon a more optimistic scenario. This scenario is the renewable energy roadmap (REmap) pro - posed by IRENA, with a 66% probability to achieve 9.7 GtCO 2 /year in 2050 to limit the temperature to 2 ◦ C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. This reference case was selected as a baseline and compared to the total emission mitigation estimations (data from IRENA [716]). 6.2. PV-T technology carbon mitigation estimates In an effort to appreciate how PV-T technologies could fit into this scenario, estimates are needed for the potential emissions savings associated with these technologies. Such estimates were made by polling the section authors to obtain quantitative estimates for the potential of the technologies they reviewed herein. Table 13 shows the estimated lifetime and annual carbon potential savings of these technologies. It is noted that these potential emission savings were estimated according to the total available area for solar installations. For the estimates listed in Table 13, it is important to note that the annual emission savings of PV-T collectors are not fixed, but depend strongly on the solar irradiance, the energy demands of the building, the operating temperature, and the CO 2 emission factors of conventional energy systems (which are country dependent, as noted in the previous section above). Therefore, the emission savings of an air-based PV-T collector installed in India is significantly higher than that of a liquid- based PV-T collector in the UK, as shown in Table 13. Similarly, the emission savings of a liquid-PV-T collector installed in Athens is more Fig. 61. Emission mitigation potential in various countries using c-Si PV panels. Figure reproduced from Briner [711]. M. Herrando et al.
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 56 than twice what it would be if installed in London and Zaragoza, owing to the high irradiance levels and high CO 2 emission factor of the elec - tricity grid in Greece [517]. In addition, it was assumed that BIPV-T technology is covered by water or air-based PV-T collectors, and only one type of spectral splitting technology (i.e., a solid-based technology) was estimated. The contri - bution of PV-T technology for hydrogen production was considered negligible, while storage systems were assumed to be included in other technologies which have storage included. Based upon Table 13, solar drying has the second highest estimated potential for emission mitigation due to the enormous land size that could be used ( > 35 million km 2 ), and solar desalination has the largest potential for carbon emission savings. However, for solar desalination, there is extremely high uncertainty in the estimate (from 0.9 to 410 MtCO 2 /year, based on adoption rates). Moreover, hybrid PV-T tech - nologies and PCM-based PV-T collectors were assumed to be competitive in terms of carbon emission mitigation (with 11 – 19 MtCO 2 /year). Other PV-T technologies, such as spectral splitting, were estimated to have a lower impact due to low adoption rates, but high carbon-saving poten - tial. It should also be noted that the low potential estimated for solar cooling systems compared to other ones can be attributed to net savings over existing high-efficiency systems in the type of building considered (large commercial buildings) and the relatively low number of systems that were estimated to be installed going forward, compared to other PV-T technology variants. 6.3. PV-T results comparison Fig. 63 shows the IRENA REmap baseline case of a 22.2-Gt CO 2 reduction in emissions by 2050 (blue curve) compared to 2020 relative to the emissions shift if PV-T technologies were installed. The red curve of “ Solar technologies emissions mitigation ” is the sum of the values pro - vided above in Table 13 for the “ Estimated maximum potential saving per year ” , with a total installation increasing linearly (e.g., assuming a linear 10% PV-T system capacity increase each year). Fig. 63 shows that, relative to the optimistic baseline emissions curve, PV-T technologies could over 10 years produce a further drop in global emissions of ~600 Mt CO 2 (~3%) by 2030 if the systems mentioned in this study are installed as estimated. Overall, this is a significant saving, one which could continue to accrue compounding savings beyond 2030 if cost re - ductions can follow a similar learning curve to PV technologies, potentially increasing to an emission mitigation potential of ~1700 Mt CO 2 (~18%) by 2050. 7. Conclusions and future outlook 7.1. Overview Based on this review, the following conclusions are drawn: ⁃ Dual air – water PV-T collectors combine the advantages of water- and air-based PV-T collectors, but they are slightly more complex and expensive than typical water-based PV-T collectors. The best design seems to have water channels in thermal contact with the PV cell rear surface and the air heat exchangers below it, also acting as thermal insulation. ⁃ It is believed that heat-pipe PV-T collectors may have the potential to overcome some of the problems faced by refrigerant-based PV-T collectors. However, this type of collector is typically harder to manufacture and integrate into larger power systems, and the operation of these systems strongly depends on the working fluid, design and performance parameters. Some investigators have concluded that the thermal performance of this type of PV-T collector is not satisfactory in cloudy, low-irradiance conditions. ⁃ BIPV-T collectors can be based on all types of PV-T collectors reviewed in this work: air, water, dual air – water, heat-pipe, PCMs. BIPV-T systems can offer savings in materials and electricity costs, thus reducing the use of fossil fuels, by simultaneously serving as a building envelope material and a power generator. However, the larger complexity and risks of BIPV-T collectors compared to standalone PV-T collectors have acted to hinder their potential and uptake, so more research is required in the detailed modelling, analysis of any impacts on the building structure, integration methods for installation as well as more experimental assessments and long-term performance analyses. ⁃ An ambitious strategy for boosting the potential and market uptake of this technology would involve optimizing PV-T collectors to deliver thermal energy at higher temperatures with simple, afford - able designs, whilst mitigating thermal and electrical losses, and ensuring collector reliability and longevity. ⁃ The selection of an appropriate PCM is key and depends on many factors, including the desired temperature of thermal output, Fig. 62.

Trade-offs are always needed between the thermal and electrical outputs. ⁃ From the perspective of achieving the smallest temperature coeffi - cient of the PV panel, it is desirable to use a high-band-gap semi - conductor, since it will leave many photons unabsorbed, which could be used for thermal generation. CdTe and GaAs cells have low- temperature coefficients. ⁃ Spectral selectivity is an attractive way to decouple thermally the thermal absorber from the PV cells, although the overall perfor - mance of each design should be relatively weighted by the values of electricity and thermal energy to the end-user, which can vary across climates and countries. ⁃ Nanofluids have demonstrated good potential for both improving the thermal conductivity of the working fluids in solar collectors, as well as the potential to make direct solar absorption working fluids. However, challenges remain to their use in practical systems where sustained efforts are still required. ⁃ Space heating can be satisfied by all the PV-T collector designs analysed in this work. The most suitable PV-T collector type depends on the specific location (solar irradiance, ambient temperature) and the space heating system, if available, among others. ⁃ Thermally-driven cooling options including absorption, desiccant, ejector and adsorption cycles are available where cooling is required and the value of heat is low. At least one relevant comparative study concluded that absorption and electric compression lead to the largest energy savings, but further studies are required to gain a Table 13 Total carbon emission mitigation estimated for selected solar PV-T technologies.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 58 complete understanding of the relevant benefits in different applications. ⁃ All PV-T collectors presented in this work can be integrated with SHC technologies to generate electricity, heating and/or cooling. The most suitable PV-T collector and SHC technology depend on the specific location (solar irradiance, ambient temperatures) and spe - cific application, among others. ⁃ Solar PV-T technology has been demonstrated in both flat-plate and concentrated solar collector designs, where the waste heat from the PV systems is used for driving thermal distillation techniques, and where the electrical energy is used for auxiliary loads and re- injection for the grid. The high energy demands of thermal distilla - tion can make an ST collector limited for clean water production. ⁃ Several studies have examined the theoretical benefits of using solar heat to augment electrolyser performance, with an up to 2.5-fold increase in the solar-to-hydrogen production for a PV-T collector over a conventional PV panel and electrolyser running at ambient temperature. ⁃ Three main aspects should be considered in the design of a TES system for employment within PV-T systems: thermal properties, cost-effectiveness, and environmental impact. ⁃ Water has a high energy density compared to other liquid-based sensible heat storage materials. Because of this, together with other advantages such as low cost, harmless nature, abundance, and ease of handling, transportation and storage, water has been the most popular and commercially used SHS material for low-temperature (~0 – 100 ◦ C) storage applications. A considerable amount of research has also been done on enhancing the thermophysical and optical properties of water through the use of nanoparticle additives. ⁃ Organic-based thermal oils have been used in elevated-temperature applications, thanks to their lower vapour pressure than water at these temperatures, while for applications at temperatures over ~400 ◦ C, molten salts are the preferred option due to their high thermal stability and very low vapour pressure. ⁃ LHS, more popularly called PCM-based TES, stores thermal energy through a phase change, which occurs at a near-fixed temperature. Attractive features of PCM-based TES technologies include high en - ergy density (compared to SHS-based TES) and a nearly isothermal process during the phase change. 7.2. Challenges for adoption Some challenges need to be overcome for the widespread of PV-T technology, including: ⁃ Further research on the integration of PV-T-based systems in the distribution grid, life cycle assessment, detailed economic analysis including key performance indicators (KPIs) such as payback time and life-cycle savings (LCS), and environmental analysis comprising KPIs such as CO 2 emission saving potential (kgCO 2 /year) and the impact on global warming (using well-known methodologies such as the ReCiPe 2016 endpoint (H/A) and the carbon footprint IPCC 2013,100 years). ⁃ Field research on long-term reliability: Due to the limited maturity of this technology, there is a lack of studies on the long-term operation of PV-T systems to assess the long-term reliability of PV-T collectors, through KPIs such as system lifetime, or degradation performance rate. ⁃ Cost: The cost of PV-T collectors is still considerably larger than the cost of separate PV panels and ST collectors. Some alternatives to decrease the cost is the replacement of c-Si PV cells with a-Si or some non-crystalline PV materials. Furthermore, the PV-T collector cost is expected to decrease with the wider installation of PV-T systems thanks to the economies of scale. ⁃ Lack of awareness: separate PV panel and ST collectors are mature and well-known technologies, while people are still not aware of the existence of hybrid PV-T collectors, their overall efficiency and high performance. This is expected to improve with the outcomes of Task 60 “ Application of PV-T Collectors and New Solutions in HVAC Systems ” of the IEA. ⁃ Lack of certification rules for PV-T collectors: Currently a specific norm for testing PV-T collectors as such is not available, and it is needed to compare the different PV-T technologies available in the market. Currently, the thermal performance of PV-T collectors can be tested according to standard ISO 9806:2017, but this has several limitations, as it is aimed at ST collectors and does not consider the electrical output. ⁃ The main technical challenges for the use of salt-hydrate-based PCMs in TES include subcooling during crystallization, incongruent melting, and corrosion in contact with some commonly used metals such as copper, aluminium, and stainless steel. TCS technology still faces the challenges of high costs, high complexity and short life - spans, and remains in the early stages of research and development. 7.3. Recommendations and future outlook Potential pathways for improvement of PV-T collectors include col - lector design modifications, the addition of PCMs, selective coatings, or the use of spectral splitting techniques or nanofluids. The following recommendations and future work are proposed: ⁃ Enhancement of PV-T collector performance through the modifica - tion of the thermal absorber to increase the heat-transfer area (for instance through extended surfaces, ribs, and corrugations), and/or the use of selective coatings by developing a cost-effective method to integrate the coating in the absorber surface. ⁃ Further research on integrating PCMs with PV-T collectors, including work in the addition of nanoparticles into PCMs (PV-T-NePCM col - lectors) to improve thermal and electrical efficiencies, as well as more research to improve the cost-competitiveness of PV-T-PCM collectors to make them practically more attractive. ⁃ More research is also required in the use of nanofluids in PV-T col - lectors, regarding the life cycle, stability and environmental impact of the nanomaterials used, as usually, nanoparticles lose their ther - mal properties over time due to degradation. ⁃ Future work in holographic filters including scaled-up demonstra - tions to prove stability, reliability, and performance along with some viable mechanisms for manufacturing cost reductions. ⁃ Although the research in luminescent concentrators has slowed down in recent years, this type of optical element could still have the potential for further development in PV-T systems. ⁃ More work is needed in optical absorption nanofluids for low tem - perature and concentration collectors to demonstrate the potential when there is actual flow in the fluid filter generating useful energy. ⁃ Proposed future work regarding thermal energy storage includes further investigations on the use of salt-hydrate-based PCMs to overcome the challenges mentioned in the previous section, as well as further research on TCS technology to face the challenges of high costs, high complexity and short lifespans. From the different applications reviewed here, the following rec - ommendations and future work are proposed: ⁃ At locations with low irradiance levels and low ambient tempera - tures, where significant space heating is required almost all year long, air-based PV-T collectors can be a cost-effective alternative, usually integrated with an HP as a backup system. ⁃ At locations with high solar irradiance and ambient temperatures, water-based PV-T collectors appear as a good alternative to pre-heat water for DHW and space heating. These collectors are usually in - tegrated with the current heating system (e.g., a boiler) as a backup and auxiliary system. M. Herrando et al.
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 59 ⁃ While there is a lot of ongoing research in solar cooling, little of it has considered PV-T collectors as a potential driver in solar-cooling systems. If scalable and cost-effective PV-T systems can be devel - oped, solar cooling is clearly an area of low-hanging fruit where they could be beneficially employed. ⁃ Combining PV-T collectors with desalination would be particularly attractive for rural areas with desalination needs to provide both clean water and useable electricity. Understanding the scope of the system in terms of water output and electrical output is further needed to fully evaluate its effectiveness. ⁃ Most of the previous work found in the literature involves theoretical studies where either the electricity or the thermal output of the CPV- T collectors are used for hydrogen production, while there are fewer practical studies on low-temperature PV-T collectors where both outputs are used in a PEM electrolyser. So convincing practical demonstrations of the potential of PV-T collectors for hydrogen production are missing.
