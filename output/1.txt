We cover both experimental and computational studies, identify opportunities for performance enhancement, pathways for collector innovation, and implications of their wider deployment at the solar-generation system level. First, we classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air – water, heat-pipe, building integrated and concentrated PV-T collectors. This is followed by a presentation of performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we address wider PV-T systems and their applications, comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S – CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S – CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying and solar for hydrogen production systems. This includes a specific review of potential performance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar- generation system level in thermal energy storage, control and demand-side management. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed to analyse their carbon mitigation potential and how this technology might fit within pathways for global decarbonization. It is estimated that the REmap baseline emission curve can be reduced by more than 16% in 2030 if the uptake of solar PV-T technologies can be promoted. Finally, the review turns to a critical examination of key challenges for the adoption of PV-T technology and recommendations. 1. Background and introduction 1.1. Context and motivation The interest in and demand for alternative energy from renewable sources has continued to rise globally in recent decades, promoted by an increase in environmental awareness and the growing importance placed on sustainability, reducing energy consumption and the associ - ated emissions and pollution. In 1992, the Rio Convention on Climate Change [1] established a framework for actions aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption and limiting the associated emissions. In 2015, over 190 countries signed a legally-binding agreement at the Paris Climate Conference [2] to keep the rise in the average global tempera - ture below 2 ◦ C (above 20th-century pre-industrial levels) [3]. To ach - ieve this challenging target, a fundamental transformation of the global energy system is required, which has in fact been taking place in recent decades [4]. Renewable energy systems have been the main drivers and will continue to be essential for this transformation as they contribute to all objectives: promoting the security of supply while lowering energy costs, reducing emissions while driving growth and generating jobs through industrial development. A record 200 GW of renewable energy capacity was added in 2019. Renewable energy accounted for 27% of global electricity use and over 18% of the world ’ s total energy con - sumption according to the latest REN21 report [5].

This growth has been made possible by the implementation of national policies that have supported renewable projects in Europe, and by the Chinese policy of subsidies for PV systems [5,7]. In 2019, the renewable energy sector employed 11.5 million people, among these 4.6 million were employed in the solar sector [8]. Solar energy is an abundant primary-energy resource, which can be exploited in cost-competitive and reliable ways for electrical power generation, either with PV technology or thermodynamic cycles in concentrated solar power (CSP) systems, as well as for heating or cooling purposes through ST systems. Some of the advantages of this renewable resource compared to others, e.g., wind, are its larger predictability on an annual basis and daily [9], the low degradation rate of the compo - nents of a solar installation during its lifetime which is generally 20 – 25 years [10,11], and that this technology rarely underperforms or fails. For example, long-term field data show that PV panels experience, on average, a power output loss of only 0.5% per year [12], and only 2% of the PV panels installed do not meet the manufacturer ’ s warranty after 10 years [13]. The total worldwide power generation capacity of installed PV panels increased by 12% in 2019 and reached a record of 630 GW in total, while the thermal energy generation capacity of installed ST col - lectors amounted to 480 GW (thermal Watt) in 2019, with China ac - counting for almost 70% of the total solar thermal capacity [6,14], which corresponds to savings of about 140 million tons of CO 2 per year [6].

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 3 countries in Europe have an installed capacity that covers above 8% of the total demand (Italy 9%, Greece 8% and Germany 8%) [5], as a result of the strong incentives for solar electricity adopted in the recent years. As a consequence of this growth, the cost of PV panels has been falling, reaching an average selling price of PV panels of 0.38 USD/W p (rated Watt peak) in 2019 [15,16], and it is becoming apparent that solar PV technologies will soon become one of the lowest-cost options for elec - tricity generation. This technology has the potential not only of providing on-grid power, displacing fossil fuel consumption, but also PV panels can provide electrification in remote rural areas, particularly in developing countries, where there is no or limited access to the elec - tricity grid. By the end of 2019, around 9.5 thousand mini-grids systems entirely or partly based on renewables were in operation together with small-scaled distributed standalone systems [17]. For instance, in China small-scale standalone PV systems substantially contributed to the progressive electrification of areas not yet interconnected to the main electricity grid [7]. The solar heat market represents a notable share of the global heating market, mainly in providing space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW) [11]. Small-scale thermosiphon systems, which account for 60% of current ST systems, are facing market pressure from heat pumps (HPs) and PV systems. The global capacity of ST decreased by 6% in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by a market slowdown in China (new collector installations in China decreased by 8%) [6]. However, the number of large-scale (megawatt-scale) ST systems for industrial applications and district heating still keeps consistently growing in recent years. For example, the market of Denmark increased by 170% in 2019 owing to several newly installed large-scale solar thermal systems [6]. Compared to the PV market, the installation of ST systems in the EU has not expe - rienced the same growth. For example, approximately 50 GW of PV panels and 15 GW of ST collectors were installed in Germany by 2019 [18]. This trend is attributed to the lack of incentives, financial support, education and knowledge [11]. The experience gained from ST in - stallations in countries such as Cyprus, Greece and Austria, indicates the great potential of such systems for utilizing solar energy, and that this potential is still far from having been exploited. Therefore, there is potential for the development and wider use of solar systems as they can help in the transformation of the worldwide energy system [19]. However, further investment in existing as well as in future solar technologies is necessary to reduce the costs and make these systems cost-competitive, as well as to ensure appropriate infra - structure [20,21], along with increased public awareness and support. If solar generation should be deployed in a distributed nature, particularly in urban environments, then the amount of suitable space for solar installations will become increasingly scarce [22]. Therefore, to be competitive, the cost per unit of energy from solar technologies should be low and the energy generated per m 2 should be maximized. PV systems are widely used and there is a broad commercial offer available in the market. However, the limited conversion efficiency, the high PV cell temperature that can be reached, which damage the PV cells, and dust accumulation, are some of the barriers that hinder their potential. In an attempt to regulate the PV cell temperature, there has been important research in the last decades in the assessment of different cooling techniques [23]. This research gave rise to hybrid PV-thermal (PV-T) collectors, which generate both electricity and useful thermal energy from the same aperture area, and with overall (electrical + thermal) efficiencies that are much higher (reaching > 70%) than separate standalone systems. PV-T collectors can easily be integrated with other system compo - nents (energy conversion, energy storage, etc.) to provide both thermal and electrical energy outputs. For example, PV-T collectors can be easily integrated with economical hot water tanks for thermal storage, and with batteries for electricity storage. Thus, this technology appears as a particularly promising alternative, especially within a high-penetration scenario, and particularly in applications such as in the urban environ - ment, where there are both thermal and electrical energy demands and the efficient use of limited space is essential. PV-T collectors can also be integrated with other types of solar collectors (i.e., PV panels or ST collectors) to adjust the ratio of heating and electricity supply, to meet specific demands [24]. The relevance and potential of PV-T collectors and their integration with other components to obtain new solutions in HVAC systems were underpinned by Task 60 “ Application of PV-T Col - lectors and New Solutions in HVAC Systems ” , which run from 2018 to 2020, in the solar heating and cooling (SHC) Programme of the Inter - national Energy Agency (IEA) [25]. 1.2. Physical considerations of PV-T collectors The initial motivation for the development of PV-T technology was the possibility of using a heat transfer fluid to cool the PV cells in such collectors. However, the delivery of a thermal output at a useful (high enough) temperature [26] leads inevitably to a conflict in the design and operation of conventional PV-T collectors, as these can be operated at temperatures higher than those of PV panels in the same conditions. When the priority is electricity generation, the heat transfer circuit is kept at a low temperature to avoid an otherwise undesirable decrease in the electrical efficiency of the PV cells. This constraint limits the use of the thermal energy generated. Therefore, a trade-off is needed depending on the specific application and the environmental conditions [27]. This introduces challenges for the design and operation of PV-T collectors, and solutions to overcome this conflict have been proposed, e.g., through spectral splitting, amongst others, presented in Section 3. The two main types of solar PV cell technologies considered for use in PV-T collectors are either based on crystalline silicon wafers or thin-film semiconductor materials deposited onto a glass or metal foil [28]. For a PV-T collector, the first significant difference is the fact that a c-Si PV panel is composed of a mosaic of discrete cells made from wafers whereas a thin-film module is made by patterning a large area of the semiconductor film. Superficially thin-film photovoltaics appears to lend themselves to PV-T collectors since, in principle, the PV cell could be deposited directly upon a thermally conductive heat exchanger. However, since silicon solar cells are manufactured as standard units that can be used interchangeably in regular PV panels and PV-T col - lectors, it is presently easier and cheaper to laminate c-Si cells to a heat sink rather than develop a bespoke process for depositing and patterning thin-film materials. This point becomes apparent when we consider the fabrication steps involved with each technology. In the case of c-Si, the process starts with processes developed for microelectronics to fabricate silicon wafers which are then processed into solar cells and then assembled into modules, usually by connecting the cells in series-connected strings, illustrated in Fig. 1(a). For a thin-film module, the process starts with the deposition of material onto a substrate (glass, metal foil, or polymer) which is then patterned using a laser to produce small strips of the active area, shown in Fig. 1(b). The patterning is necessary since the current density arising from a typical PV material is of the order 300 A m 2 . The issue does not arise in silicon modules since the series-connected silicon cells naturally divide this large current density by a factor of ~30. The spectral breath of sunlight places firm boundaries around the efficiency of PV power conversion but many of the losses in a standard PV cell can be recovered as thermal energy in a PV-T system. To indicate how much thermal and electrical energy is available we develop a simple model to quantify the losses. Sunlight spans photon energies ranging from 0.4 to 4 eV and is plotted as a spectral flux b( E ) in Fig. 2(a). An ideal semiconductor absorber with a band-gap E g will selectively absorb sunlight with photon energies above that band-gap energy thereby promoting an electron from the valance band to the conduction band (Process 1 in Fig. 2 (b)) M. Herrando et al.
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 4 while light below the band-gap energy will pass unabsorbed through the solar (Process 2 in Fig. 2(b)). For simplicity, in the example shown in Fig. 2(b) the excess photon energy ( E g ) is imparted to the excited elec - tron 1 that rapidly dissipates this energy through a thermalization pro - cess (Process 3 in Fig. 2(b)) to establish a thermal population of excited electrons. The occupation of electrons in the conduction band can be described by a quasi-Fermi level denoted by μ c and a similar quasi-Fermi level denoted by μ v for the holes. The separation of these quasi-Fermi levels results in the voltage ( V ) at the solar cell terminals which in turn drives current ( I ) through a load in the external circuit. Two limiting cases for the solar cell configuration are shown in Fig. 2 (c), in both cases the PV active photons are illustrated by the blue arrow while the pink arrow indicates sub-band-gap photons that are not absorbed by the semiconductor material. Most non-silicon solar cells correspond to Fig. 2(c – i) where the unabsorbed low-energy photons are reflected from the rear surface and leave the solar cell. Fig. 2(c-ii) shows a configuration where low-energy photons are absorbed by a separate thermal absorber. Uniquely silicon solar cells correspond to Fig. 2(c-ii) where the absorptivity of the solar cell is close to unity from UV through to the mid-IR hence completely extinguishing the solar [29,30]. Only the radiative recombination loss (Process 4 in Fig. 2(b)) is irrecoverable in a PV-T system. However, even in the radiative limit, it is a comparatively small fraction of the overall solar cell power-loss when operating at the maximum power-point [31]. Furthermore, in almost all solar cell semiconductor materials, parasitic non-radiative processes that operate in parallel to the radiative loss tend to be orders of magnitude larger, hence for a practical PV-T system recombination losses can be assumed to generate heat, rather than light. In the solar cell configuration shown in Fig. 2(c – i) the energy associated with the belo - w- E g loss (Process 2 in Fig. 2(b)) is lost from the solar cell however in the solar cell configuration shown in Fig. 2(c-ii), it results in the full ab - sorption of the solar flux. To illustrate the behaviour of two different solar cell types, we consider the limiting cases of silicon ( E g = 1.12 eV) and CdTe ( E g = 1.5eV) that correspond to the top-two solar cell terrestrial solar cell technologies manufactured by the capacity to date [32].

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 5 where J sc is the cell short-circuit current density, J 01 is the diode satu - ration current density, q is the electronic charge and k is Boltzmann ’ s constant. Assuming full absorption to the band-gap energy E g and in the absence of reflectivity losses, the upper limit to the solar cell short- circuit current is given by: J sc   E g ) = q ∫ ∞ E g b ( E ) d E (1.2) The thermal generation in a PV cell can be approximated by: Q ( V ) = ∫ ∞ E th E b ( E ) d E   V I ( V ) (1.3) where E th is the threshold for the onset of absorption in the PV-T collector. Taking illustrative examples of a CdTe solar cell ( E th = E g = 1.5 eV, J 01 = 5.54 × 10   13 A m   2 ) and silicon solar cell ( E th = 0 eV, E g = 1.1 eV, J 01 = 7.64 × 10   10 A m   2 ), the current – voltage characteristics, elec - trical power and thermal generation are plotted in Fig. 3. The electricity generation potential of the PV cells is typically the primary energy output of PV-T collectors. In the two examples here, the IV characteristics of silicon and CdTe cells are broadly determined by their band-gap energy. The lower band-gap of silicon provides a larger current but smaller voltage compared to CdTe. The optimum band-gap energy for electrical power conversion is approximately 1.3 eV, which is between the band-gaps of CdTe and silicon [31]. The electrical power delivered by the two cells is broadly similar but the maximum power point for the CdTe cell sits at a higher voltage than the silicon. All PV cell parameters are dependent upon temperature, hence the power that is delivered by a PV device is: P ( T ) = V oc ( T ) J sc ( T ) FF ( T ) (1.4) The temperature coefficient of power ( β Pmax ) is composed of the sum of three different coefficients: β Pmax = β Voc + β Jsc + β FF (1.5) Of these temperature coefficients, the voltage coefficient ( β Voc ) dominates the power loss with increasing temperature, owing to an in - crease in internal recombination rate with temperature. The tempera - ture coefficient is weakly positive since the thermal expansion of the semiconductor lattice leads to a reduction in the electronic band-gap and hence marginally higher absorbed photon flux. The fill factor ( FF ) also has a weak dependence on temperature. The temperature dependency of the fill factor depends largely on the cell voltage and any temperature dependency of series resistance R s : 1 FF d FF d T = ( 1   1 . 02 FF 0 ) ( 1 V oc d V oc d T   1 T )   R s V oc / I sc   R s ( 1 R s d R s d T ) (1.6) In turn, the temperature dependency of voltage depends on the band- gap energy, the V oc and an empirical parameter γ that accounts for the recombination mechanisms present in the solar cell [33]: d V oc d T =   E g q   V oc + γ kT q T (1.7) Overall, this gives a strong temperature coefficient dependency with band-gap energy ( E g ). Cells with low band-gaps, such as Ge have large, negative temperature coefficients power, with silicon and other con - ventional PV materials having correspondingly smaller temperature coefficients. Therefore, from the perspective of achieving the smallest temperature coefficient, it is desirable to use a high-band-gap semi - conductor. Since a high band-gap will leave many photons unabsorbed, these could be used in a thermal collector. It is also worth noting that in Eq. (1.6), the V oc itself also affects the temperature coefficient. From a wider PV-T perspective, however, the thermal generation potential of these collectors when using different solar cell technologies will also be of interest and this can be substantially different (refer back to Fig. 3(c) for the two cell types considered above). Under short-circuit and open-circuit, no electrical power is delivered, but since the silicon solar cell absorbs the full solar spectrum, the thermal generation equates to the incident solar energy. The CdTe device only absorbs light above the band-gap energy, giving substantially lower thermal generation. At the maximum power point, the thermal generation reaches a minimum, yet the silicon cell still delivers 750 W/m 2 at maximum power, while the CdTe cell only reaches 400 W/m 2 . We will return to the current elec - trical and thermal performance of different PV-T collectors in Section 2 and the potential for improvement in Section 3. 1.3. Previous reviews Almost all previous review papers on PV-T technology focussed on this technology at the collector level, reviewing various design and geometrical configurations based on different thermal management concepts. Older reviews focussed on air- or liquid-based PV-T collectors [34 – 36], while more recent ones also include concentrated PV-T (CPV-T) collectors [37], heat-pipe PV-T collectors [23,38 – 40], phase-change material (PCM)-based PV-T collectors [23,28,38 – 41], dual air – water PV-T and PV-T collectors with nanofluids [38,39,42,43]. Some of them review alternative structural designs [23,35,42,44], while others analyse the PV-T layers [44], and parameters that affect the performance of flat-plate PV-T collectors [45]. Other reviews analysed previous studies that discussed the design and cooling considerations aimed at improved collector performance [46], or reviewed studies that included environmental issues about PV-T systems [40] and analysed factors that affect PV-T collectors from an environmental point of view [47]. Others also include a review of the progress on practical PV-T applications [28,37,41], analysing the limitations and advantages of PV-T collectors [28]. Meanwhile, other reviews specifically focussed on liquid-based PV-T collectors [48], reviewing previous experimental and simulation studies of refrigerant-based and water-based PV-T collectors. There are several reviews of solar cooling systems, mostly focussed Fig. 3. Characteristic performance of solar cells made from silicon solar cell (solid line) and CdTe solar cell (dashed line) showing: (a) the IV characteristics; (b) electrical power; and (c) thermal generation.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 6 on the integration of ST collectors, including flat-plate collectors (FPCs), evacuated-tube collectors (ETCs) and parabolic-trough collectors (PTCs), with thermally-driven cooling technologies, including ab/ adsorption [49 – 59], desiccant [53 – 56,59], ejector/Rankine [54,55,59, 60] or Stirling [59] systems. Some reviews also address PV panels in - tegrated with HPs [49,51,53,55,59], Stirling or thermoelectric [59] systems, while a previous review of solar systems integrated with ab - sorption HPs [57] includes a section on PV-T systems, but as a separate system from the HP (see Table 1). Two recent reviews on solar heating and cooling (SHC) technologies report several alternatives for solar heating or cooling, without addressing combined heating and cooling technologies. One review focusses on solar thermal based on FPC/ETC or solar air collectors, or alternatively PV panels; air-based PV-T and water-based PV-T systems are briefly discussed as solar heating systems [61]. The second review covers solar thermal and electrical systems, electrical and thermal storage options, heat pumps and solar cooling alternatives, without specifically addressing PV-T collectors, but mentioning previous PV-T studies [62]. We have found very few review papers that specifically address PV-T collectors and wider systems for heating and/or cooling applications [63 – 65] (see Table 1). Amongst these, Guo et al. [63] focusses on PV-T façade and solar thermal (air/water) desiccant systems for cooling and dehumidification, while Alobaid et al. [64] review current de - velopments of PV-T collectors integrated with absorption cooling sys - tems. A recent paper [69] briefly reviews SHC systems by absorption and adsorption systems driven by solar thermal (FPC/ETC/PFC) or PV-T/CPV-T collectors, focussing on the modelling and simulation of polygeneration systems based con PV-T/CPV-T collectors for the pro - vision of cooling, heating and power to buildings. Other studies review the integration of ST and PV-T collectors with solar assisted heat pumps (SAHP) for heating purposes [65 – 68], (a) analysing and comparing previous studies of PV, ST or PV-T collectors integrated air-source HPs [66], (b) reviewing mathematical models for SAHP systems and per - formance enhancements [67], or (c) specifically focussing on reviewing the performance, component details and of research progress of PV-T-SAHP systems [68,70]. However, none of the above [65 – 68] is specifically focussed on PV-T collectors, and none of them addresses other applications such as solar cooling, desalination, drying or hydrogen production. 1.4. Aim and contribution This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of- the-art in PV-T collectors and of the wider solar-energy systems within which they can be implemented, and also to assess the local (at the end- user/building level) and worldwide energy and carbon mitigation po - tential of such systems. In this review, we cover experimental and computational studies, identify performance enhancement opportunities and innovation path - ways and, also, the implications of widespread deployment at the solar- generation system level. Specifically, we first proceed to classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid- based, dual air – water, heat-pipe, building-integrated and CPV-T col - lectors (Section 2). This is followed by a presentation of techno- economic performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation (Section 3). Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we include content with a particular focus on wider PV-T-based systems and their applications (Section 4), comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S – CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S – CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying systems, and solar for hydrogen production. This includes a specific review of potential per - formance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar- generation system level in thermal energy storage, component integra - tion, control and demand-side management (DSM) (Section 5). Throughout the paper, we review research lines extending, importantly, to research gaps and opportunities to promote the technology readiness levels (TRLs) of important related elements of wider PV-T-based systems. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed in a series of decarbonization scenarios to analyse the carbon mitigation potential of PV-T systems and how this technology could fit in various pathways for global decarbonization (Section 6). Finally, the review will turn to a critical examination of the future of PV-T tech - nology and systems, including challenges, recommendations and main conclusions (Section 7). 2. Solar PV-T collectors Most of the solar radiation absorbed by a PV cell is converted to heat (in fact, internal energy), increasing the temperature of the cell and decreasing its electrical efficiency [35,71 – 73]. To overcome this, solar cells can be cooled by a suitable fluid (gas or liquid) flow, decreasing their temperature and improving their efficiency, while producing a useful thermal output. The synergistic combination of the improved electrical output and the associated heat provision potential has moti - vated the development of hybrid PV-T collectors [35,71 – 73], which have emerged as holistic solar energy solutions that combine PV cells for electricity generation, coupled with a thermal absorber containing a heat transfer fluid for heat provision from the same collector [71, 74 – 77]. PV-T collectors enable the generation and use of electricity onsite, so-called self-consumption, which is acknowledged as the cheapest way to generate energy with renewables while reducing the stress on the local grid [4,78]. PV-T collectors can be integrated with other technol - ogies such as HPs or cooling systems [64,79], can be used for solar desalination [80,81], solar drying [82,83], or hydrogen production [84, 85], and the excess electricity generated can be stored to be used later on [86 – 90]. Moreover, careful planning of the energy use via DSM is of key importance in the effective operation of the system [86,87], as detailed in Section 5.3. There are several classifications of hybrid PV-T collectors depending on different factors: (a) the collector cover(s); (b) the type of PV Table 1 Summary of previous reviews. Ref.

There are different methods to cool the PV panel, and the optimum solution strongly depends on several factors such as the PV technology used, the concentration ratio (if any) and the weather conditions where the system is installed [23]. The two main cooling mechanisms are passive and active cooling. The former refers to technologies that minimize or extract the heat absorbed by the PV panel without addi - tional power consumption. There are different options such as the integration on the rear PV panel surface of fins or other extruded sur - faces made of high thermal conductivity metals such as aluminium or copper, to enhance heat transfer to the ambient; the use of PCMs or the use of heat pipes that efficiently transfer the heat through a boiling-condensing process. The main constraint of these alternatives is that the heat dissipation is limited by the contact area between the heat sink and the ambient [23,41]. Alternatively, active cooling systems extract the heat using different cooling fluids driven by fans in case of air or a pump when liquids are used. The cooling medium can be in the liquid or gaseous phase. The most common liquid used in flat-plate PV-T collectors is water or a mixture of water and glycol to avoid freezing. Meanwhile, air-based PV- T collectors provide a simpler solution to cool solar PV cells. For each of these types of PV-T systems, there are several designs of the thermal absorber, as shown in the following sections. The potential of PV-T systems has been confirmed with simulations in reliable computational environments such as ANSYS Fluent, COM - SOL, MATLAB, Modelica, Polysun, TRANSOL, and TRNSYS. However, despite their demonstrated potential, only a modest number of manu - facturers are producing PV-T collectors and the market remains small [91,92]. A market survey was undertaken under Task 60 of the Inter - national Energy Agengy (IEA), with 26 collector manufacturers and suppliers from 11 countries identified. The survey showed that most of the manufacturers focus on liquid-based PV-T collectors (48% uncov - ered PV-T collectors, 28% covered PV-T collectors, 4% vacuum tube PV-T collectors), while 12% manufacture air-based PV-T collectors and 8% CPV-T collectors [92]. Fig. 4 shows the performance of commercially available PV-T col - lectors, in terms of both thermal and electrical outputs. Note that the CPV-T options shown are low-concentrating ratios, without tracking. It should be highlighted that a specific norm for testing PV-T collectors is not available currently, so the thermal and electrical outputs are often stated at different conditions, and thus comparisons among different products are not straightforward. The thermal performance of PV-T collectors can be tested according to the standard ISO 9806:2017, but this has several limitations, as it is intended for ST collectors, so the electrical output is not considered. For the PV panel output, there is a standard procedure, following the methodology of the IEC 60904, and usually, this output is provided by the PV panel manufacturer. However, if PV cell performance is not characterized before its integration into a PV-T collector, it should be characterized accordingly when character - izing the PV-T collector, separately from the thermal performance characterization [93]. Fig. 5 shows a map of the same commercially available PV-T col - lectors in terms of the market price (as of 2020 when this data was collected) vs . their estimated thermal and electrical outputs. It is observed that, in general, water-based PV-T collectors have larger out - puts (W/m 2 ) at a lower price ( € /m 2 ). By the end of 2019, a total PV-T collector area of 1,160,000 m 2 was installed, with a total thermal capacity of around 530 MW and a peak PV power of around 180 MW. In the European market, France is the market leader with an installed collector area of approximately 484,000 m 2 , followed by Germany with around 112,000 m 2 . Outside of Europe, Korea is the market leader with an installed area of ~280,000 m 2 , fol - lowed by China with ~133,000 m 2 [6]. From the total installed thermal capacity, 57% corresponds to uncovered water-based PV-T collectors, 41% to air-based PV-T collectors and the remaining 2% to covered water-based PV-T collectors, while vacuum tube PV-T collectors and CPV-T collectors play only a minor role [92].

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 8 2.1. Air-based PV-T collectors In air-based PV-T collectors, air is selected as the working (or, heat transfer) fluid, and acts to regulate the temperature of the PV cells. The main applications of this type of collector are for ventilation and space heating, or air-preheating purposes, integrated into roofs and building façades [23,73], or installed as independent components on roofs [34], where the generated hot air can be used for drying, space heating or ventilation. There are two main types of air-based PV-T collectors, namely flat- plate and CPV-T collectors. Flat-plate collectors are considered the most common and simple design [94]. Air-based PV-T collectors typi - cally have a lower capital cost than liquid-based equivalents and are suitable for building applications in medium- and high-latitude regions. In low-latitude regions, the ambient air temperature during the day is high for almost half of the year, therefore limiting the application of air-based PV-T systems to a shorter period in terms of effective elec - tricity production. There are different configurations according to several factors. First, these systems can be classified depending on how the air flows through the system. Natural circulation is simpler and has lower costs than forced circulation, while the latter is more efficient. However, the en - ergy necessary to drive fans decreases the net electricity gain of the system in forced circulation systems [71]. While liquid-based PV-T collectors need a restricted passage to allow the liquid flow near the PV cells ’ back surface (usually a pipe or conduit), the air is allowed to flow both at the back and over the front surfaces of PV cells in air-based PV-T collectors. This can be done with mechanical power, i.e., a fan, or the flow can be naturally driven by buoyancy forces. When air is flowing over the front surface of cells, an extra glazing layer is required to form a passage between the cells and the environment. Although this is bene - ficial from a thermal performance perspective, it is less effective con - cerning electrical performance, as it increases the operating PV cell temperature for the same conditions, and imposes an additional reflec - tion loss to the incoming solar radiation. According to Chow [35], we can discriminate between four main collector types, depending on the air channel configuration, with PV-T collectors having: a channel above the PV cells, a channel below the PV cells, the PV cells between single-pass channels, and double-glass designs (see Fig. 6). The most noticeable difference is the duct that brings the cold (ambient or recirculated) air towards the collector, usually at the bottom of the collector, and the duct that removes the hot air usually from the top of the collector. Sometimes recirculation is used, i.e., the air flows first over the PV cell ’ s top surfaces and then directed underneath them before exiting the collector (Design (d) in Fig. 6). In this case, the inlet and outlet ducts are at the same end of the collector, usually the bottom one, reducing the height of the collector but also causing shading between subsequent rows. Different conclusions have been drawn, for example, some studies conclude that double-pass designs (Design (d) in Fig. 6) outperform single- pass designs, while others conclude that Design (c) is the least consuming in terms of fan power [35]. Other investigators considered double-glass PV-T collectors [41], or the addition of a suspended metal sheet in the middle of the air channel to improve thermal performance [23]. In the comprehensive review of air-based PV-T systems with and without thermal storage by Tyagi et al. [95], it was concluded that air-based PV-T systems are particularly well-suited to crop drying and electricity production. Additionally, the application of PCMs for thermal storage in PV-T systems was mentioned. Another review presented a broad classification of PV-T systems, an extensive list of important aspects of these systems together with sug - gestions for future work needed on the subject [96]. It was stated that air-based PV-T systems are most suitable for space heating applications in cold regions, since the ambient air temperature during the day is low most of the year, therefore eliminating the loss of effective electricity production while taking advantage of the collected heat from the PV-T collector for space heating. The status and future perspectives of PV-T systems, in particular air- based PV-T systems, have also been reviewed [39,43]. According to Al-Waeli et al. [39], air-based PV-T collectors have general overall ef - ficiencies (electrical plus thermal) ranging from 30% to 60%. Of this total efficiency, the electrical component associated with crystalline silicon PV cells is typically in the range of 15 – 20% at typical operating temperatures. A review with attention to different solar cell technologies and recent techniques to improve such systems concluded that PV cells integrated with ST systems are self-sustained and more economical in rural areas [97]. A review focussing on the design of PV-T systems [46] highlighted the importance of nanofluids and nano-PCMs as alternatives or complementary to traditional cooling and storage solutions. From this analysis, it was concluded that cooling both sides of PV cells, with the employment of op - tical filtration using nanofluids, can result in significant improvements to the performance of a PV-T system. In addition, optimization of the cross-section of cooling channels and the use of honeycombs and nano-PCMs for storage and cooling purposes can provide better distribution of the thermal load. Guidelines for the appropriate selection of the channel depth, air flow rate and air distribution duct diameter optimization in PV-T collectors have also been studied [98]. An extensive study of the air cooling design and performance in a commercial air-based PV-T collector by natural flow is reported in Ref. [99], which suggests optimal configurations for PV-T solar systems. Other authors [100] investigated air-based PV-T collectors through modelling at steady-state conditions, to determine their thermal char - acteristics. ¨ Ozakin and Kaya [101] studied an air-cooled channel in an air-based PV-T collector to consider the effects of fins added to the channel and to estimate the exergetic performance of the collector. A similar study [102] presented a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of such collectors. A glazed collector was also tested experimentally by Agrawal and Tiwari [103,104], who estimated a payback period for the system of 1.8 years and 16.5 tons of CO 2 emission avoidance. The performance of four different air-based PV-T collector configu - rations with single-pass, double-pass and with glazing was studied by Slimani et al. [105], who concluded that the double-pass collector per - forms better in terms of overall daily energy generation. According to Hussain et al. [106], further work on efficiency improvements, cost Fig. 6. Longitudinal cross-section of common air-based PV-T collector designs.

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 9 reductions and building integration of air-based PV-T collectors are necessary for good performance to be attained. Several researchers have paid attention to various air-channel con - figurations. A theoretical analysis of air-based PV-T collectors [107] concluded that a glass cover improves the thermal efficiency of the sys - tem but reduces the electrical efficiency, in line with other similar work in the literature. It was additionally concluded that the solar radiation in - tensity, flow rate and channel depth are important parameters that in - fluence the system performance. Another study focussing on the channel configuration with additional fins and metal sheets in the flow channel [99] concluded that the addition of fins and metal sheets in the channel can improve the system performance. Metal sheets in the channel were also investigated by Shahsavar and Ameri [108] (see Table 2). A transpired collector with a transparent channel for air circulation was tested by Gholampour and Ameri [109]. Experimental validation of a model was performed with CFD modelling in Fluent, obtaining thermal system efficiencies of 45 – 55%. Other studies have used modelling to investigate the performance of air PV-T systems [100,113,117], or a combination of theoretical analyses, modelling and experimental in - vestigations [113,114]. A summary of the different air-based PV-T collectors is provided in Table 2, addressing previous research on PV-T collectors with and without glazing, different arrangements of air channels, forced circula - tion by fans, adding fins in the air channel and size of the air channel. It can be concluded that double-pass PV-T collectors outperform single- pass designs, that glazed PV-T collectors have higher overall effi - ciencies than unglazed collectors, and that the use of metal sheets and fins in the air channel increases the thermal efficiency. The most common air-based PV-T configurations have a high TRL of 9 (actual system proven in operational environment), with several manufacturers on the market, such as GSE and Sunovate, as detailed in the market survey undertaken under Task 60 of the IEA [25,92]. Ac - cording to this survey, the French market is dominant, where almost all of the manufactured PV-T collectors are air-based PV-T collectors [92]. 2.2. Liquid-based PV-T collectors Liquid cooling offers a better alternative to air cooling enabling to maintain the desired operating temperature of the PV cells with fewer temperature fluctuations together with more efficient use of the heat extracted, due to the higher thermal conductivity and better heat transfer coefficient [23,35,41,48]. The most common fluid employed is water, or a mixture of water-glycol to avoid freezing [23,37,48], although refrigerants capable to undergo phase change at relatively low temperatures have been used to integrate these collectors with HPs [23, 28]. 2.2.1. Water-based PV-T collectors Water-based collectors are considered the most efficient type of PV-T technology for applications where water preheating is required all year long at locations with high solar input and high ambient temperature (low latitudes) [35,48,73,118]. In recent decades, significant research has been undertaken on this type of collector, giving rise to a large number of water-based PV-T system configurations, both in terms of materials and geometries [28,34,35,41,48]. Here it should be noted that this section considers both water and water-glycol mixtures as the heat transfer fluid without a specific differentiation. From the different de - signs found in literature, the main design concepts are [23,28,34,35,41, 48,119] (see Fig. 7): Copper is the most widely used material for several reasons, including primarily its high thermal conductivity. The most common PV-T collector design comprises a metallic sheet-and-tube absorber adhered to the rear of PV cells in which the liquid is circulated via forced convection through pipes connected in series or parallel (Design (a) in Fig. 7) [23,28,41,121]. Furthermore, the most common collector design features parallel pipes (Fig. 8) with diameters of 6 – 7 mm [122,123], 8 mm [121,122,124], 10 mm [27,71,125,126], 15 mm [74] (see Table 3); while serpentine arrangements are typically used in refrigerant-based PV-T collectors (see Section 2.2.2). Investigators have analysed serpentine water-based PV-T collectors with tube diameters of 10 mm [127] or 8 mm [128]. Table 3 summarizes the main outcomes of previous research on these types of configurations. Alternatively, web-flow, direct-flow (also called parallel-pipes) or spiral-flow designs (Fig. 8) made of stainless steel have been also ana - lysed by other authors [119,129]. The results show that, at an outlet temperature of 50 – 65 ◦ C, the web-flow design performs the worst, with thermal efficiencies from 41% to 48% depending on the flow rate, the direct-flow design performs slightly better (46 – 54%), while the spiral-flow design performs the best, with thermal efficiencies of 58 – 68%, and the highest electrical efficiencies (13 – 14%), due to the lower PV cell temperature [129].

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 10 Each of the aforementioned configurations can be further divided depending on the number of covers (zero, one or two; see Table 3), whether an opaque or transparent PV panel is used or whether they have an additional transparent insulating layer between the channels (Design (d) in Fig. 7) [120]. Most of the studies apply the cooling water at the rear of the PV cells, with a reflective Tedlar layer in between, decreasing the efficiency of the heat extraction. There are several ways to overcome this problem, such as using a different layer (Tedlar-polyester-Tedlar) Fig. 7. Cross-section of some common water-based PV-T collector designs [35,36,120].

Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 11 with good electrical insulation and thermal conduction. However, this usually leads to a more complex design. The two-absorber PV-T collector (Design (d) in Fig. 7) uses a transparent PV laminate as a primary absorber and a black metal absorber as a secondary absorber, with water flowing in through the upper channel and then returning in the opposite direction through the lower one (underneath the PV laminate) [120, 130]. PV cells receive most of the visible radiation as glass and water have high transmittance, and the infrared part of the solar spectrum is mostly absorbed by water, which also cools the solar cells preventing the decrease in efficiency due to an increase in the cell temperature [75]. The results show that this design achieves higher thermal efficiency than a single-cover sheet-and-tube PV-T collector (66% vs . 58% respectively at zero reduced temperature [120]; see Table 3), but the transparent PV laminates are more expensive and this design is heavier and more fragile due to the larger amount of glass required [120,130]. Another alterna - tive is to let the fluid flow over the absorber (free flow panel, Design (b) in Fig. 7) [131], but the results show that evaporation strongly reduces the thermal efficiency and the condensate on top of the glass causes additional reflection, so the authors concluded that water is not an appropriate choice for this type of collectors [120]. Amongst the various thermal absorber configurations for PV-T col - lectors found in the relevant literature, those featuring parallel tubes (sheet-and-tube) are the most common [27,120,125,134 – 136], with high TRLs of 9. Most of the water-based PV-T collectors commercially available are based on thermally attaching mono-crystalline PV cells on top of flat-plate solar collectors [91,92,137 – 140]. According to the market survey undertaken under Task 60 [25,92], most of the PV-T manufacturers focus on liquid-based PV-T collectors, particularly on uncovered water-based PV-T collectors (48%), such as Caotec, DualSun, Fototherm, Meyer Burger, Racell, Solator, Solink; followed by covered water-based PV-T collectors (28%), such as Abora Solar, EndeF, Solvis; and vacuum tube PV-T collectors (4%), such as Naked Energy [92]. 2.2.2. Refrigerant-based PV-T collectors In refrigerant-based PV-T collectors, the PV-T collector usually acts as the evaporator of an HP [141], forming the so-called PV-T-SAHP [23, 68]. Here, direct expansion evaporation coils are integrated underneath the PV cells (see Fig. 9), so when the refrigerant flows through the modules it evaporates at low temperatures (0 – 20 ◦ C) [41,142], cooling down the PV cells. This allows the PV cells to operate at low tempera - tures and therefore achieve higher electrical efficiencies [143,144]. Typically these collectors have a serpentine design made of copper coils [146] of around 6 – 7 mm inner diameter [143,144,147 – 150], but there are also examples of copper parallel tubes of larger (10 mm) inner diameters [151] (see Fig. 9). Meanwhile, Mohanraj et al. [152] proposed to alternate circular tubes of 9.52 mm with equilateral triangular tubes of 12 mm to increase the heat transfer area and thus absorb more thermal energy. The results showed a 4 – 13% higher electrical efficiency and 4 – 9% higher evaporator heat gain compared to a circular tube configuration. Tsai [153] proposed a rooftop PV-T collector where multi-port copper tubes assembled in parallel are attached to the rear surface of the PV cells. In this line, a more recent work analysed a serpentine microchannel PV-T collector integrated into an opaque ventilated façade [154]. Alternatively, Xu et al. [142] proposed multi-port flat extruded aluminium tubes of 3.35 × 3 mm channels, increasing the contact sur - face, enhancing heat transfer and thus increasing the thermal efficiency by 6%. A similar design was proposed by Zhou et al. [155], where microchannel rectangular pipes (2 × 6 mm) are welded to the absorber plate of the PV-T collector (see Table 4). They concluded that this design improved heat transfer while reducing manufacturing costs due to the smaller size and weight. More recently, other authors have proposed a roll-bond design with serpentine aluminium coils as the PV-T collector evaporator [156,157]. In an attempt to reduce thermal losses, another study [158] proposed a glass vacuum tube PV-T collector, with a U-shape copper tube of 6 mm as the evaporator and a-Si PV cells. There are also examples of refrigerant-based CPV-T collectors, such as the one proposed by Xu et al. [159], where a multi-port flat extruded aluminium tube in a serpentine format acts as the evaporator of a low-concentrated PV-T parabolic collector (concentration ratio of 1.6). Also in related work, the experimental study by Fang et al. [151] concluded that a refrigerant-based PV-T can improve the electrical effi - ciency by 24% relative to that of a conventional PV panel, due to the lower operating temperatures of the PV cells in the former. Similar results have been recently found by Vaishak and Bhale [149]. Several studies also concluded that the COP and the condenser heat capacity decrease with the increase in condenser water supply temperature [147,158]. Different refrigerants have been used as working fluids, such as R134A, R12, R22 [144,145,150,157,160], R410A [155], R600A, R407C [161] or R404A [68] (see Table 4). The performance analysis has shown that R12 and R22 outperform other fluids (e.g., can achieve a higher COP), but in turn, they have a negative environmental impact [162]. R134A is used in most of the reported studies [147,153,154,158,159, 163], which has a similar performance to R12 and R22 [162], while it is more environmentally friendly [68]. Among the others, R410A is more efficient than R407C and R404A, and despite its lower (15 – 20%) per - formance than R134A [162], it has been identified as an ideal substitute because of its good chemical and thermal stability [68,155]. Previous research on refrigerant-based PV-T collectors has mainly focussed on: (a) analysing the influence of different design factors (top cover, PV cells, evaporation and condensation temperatures of the HP) on the system efficiencies [144,147,158]; (b) optimizing the collector design (geometrical shape, diameter size or packing factor) [145,164]; (c) analysing the experimental performance of the PV-T collector and its integration with an HP [144,149,151,153,157,160]; and (d) assessing the annual performance of the PV-T-SAHP system in one [149] or several [142] geographical locations. Refrigerant-based PV-T collectors usually have larger electrical ef - ficiencies than air- or water-based PV-T collectors, due to the lower operating temperature of the PV cells [37,41], but they have some dis - advantages such as the high risk of refrigerant leakage [41], uneven refrigerant distribution in evaporation tubes [165,166], potentially Fig. 9. Schematic of refrigerant-based PV-T collector [68,145]. M. Herrando et al.

Recently, Vaishak and Bhale [68] stated that some of these limitations might be overcome to some extent by heat-pipe PV-T collectors (see Section 2.3 for more details). The most common refrigerant-based PV-T configurations have a TRL of 7 – 8, consisting of a PV-T-SAHP system where the PV-T collector acts as the HP evaporator. However, according to the market survey of Task 60 [92], currently, there are no manufacturers of this type of PV-T collector. 2.3. Heat-pipe PV-T collectors Heat pipes are highly efficient heat-transfer devices that have been widely used in various fields such as spacecraft and electronics cooling. Heat pipes have the advantages of high heat transfer rates, no moving parts, no energy consumption, and long service lifetimes, among others [167]. A typical heat pipe usually consists of two main sections: the evaporator and the condenser (see Fig. 10). The evaporator absorbs heat and evaporates the working fluid, which is then condensed in the condenser, releasing heat. Heat pipes have an ultra-high heat transfer effectiveness due to the phase change process. Considering the afore - mentioned advantages, heat pipes have been applied to PV-T collectors, specifically for the effective removal of waste heat in PV cells, and it is thought that heat-pipe PV-T collectors may have the potential to over - come some of the problems refrigerant-based PV-T collectors [41]. Fig. 10 shows a schematic of a heat-pipe PV-T collector. The heat pipe is tightly attached to the back side of PV cells to absorb residual heat. The heat is then transported through the heat pipe and recovered by a fluid at the condensation end of the heat pipe, which can then be delivered for downstream use. The heat pipe can be considered a heat-transfer me - dium with a very high thermal conductivity. Two main types of heat pipe have been applied to heat-pipe PV-T collectors, specifically microchannel flat heat pipes [168,169] and cy - lindrical heat pipes [170 – 172]. Fig. 11 shows a heat-pipe PV-T collector designed and tested by Pei et al. [173]. An array of cylindrical copper heat pipes was attached to the bottom of the PV cells, and the waste heat was removed and transported through the heat pipe array into the water box at the top of the panel. The system daily thermal efficiency increased from 45% to 55% as the heat pipe number increased from 5 to 15 [172]. The heat-pipe PV-T collector has an anti-freezing ability if the working fluid is selected appropriately and thus has a better performance in cold regions compared to conventional water-based collectors [173]. Low-boiling point refrigerants (e.g., R134A) can be used as working fluids in cold regions to overcome the freezing problem [170].

Herrando et al.
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 13 their high equivalent thermal conductivity, heat pipes maintain a uni - form temperature distribution over the PV cells. The temperature dif - ference between PV cells cooled by heat pipes was found to be less than 2.5 ◦ C in the outdoor experiments of Wu et al. [174]. The performance of a heat-pipe PV-T collector with microchannel flat heat pipes in different seasons was investigated by Hou et al. [169], who found that the ther - mal efficiency was over 40% in summertime. Overall, the thermal effi - ciency of a heat-pipe PV-T collector strongly depends on its structure, the working fluid and the distribution of the heat pipe array, and typi - cally varies from around 40% [169,172] to 60% [172,174,175]. Heat pipes are particularly effective at removing the high-flux waste heat in concentrated PV panels. In this context, the experimental results by Farahat [176] showed that the heat pipe delivered a more effective and reliable cooling for the concentrated PV panel compared to a con - ventional water cooling method. A concentrated heat-pipe PV-T system with a microchannel heat pipe was built and tested by Chen et al. [168], reaching thermal and electrical efficiencies of 55% and 15%, respec - tively, with the solar panel temperature at about 60 ◦ C. Attempts have also been made to convert recovered thermal energy from PV-T collectors into additional (secondary) electricity, e.g., using an integrated heat-pipe PV-T and thermoelectric generator (TEG) module design in which the condenser section of the heat pipe was directly contacted with the TEG [177,178]. In such applications, TEGs are in competition with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems (discussed further in Section 4.1.1), Stirling engines, etc., whose effi - ciency and cost are both scale and temperature-dependent [179]. However, the economic viability of using a secondary power system to recover and convert excess PV-T thermal energy remains low at present, due to the inherently low efficiency of the secondary power system at temperatures below 100 ◦ C, the added complexity and cost, and the alternative of generating additional electricity by increasing the total installed PV-T or PV area. In any case, experimental results showed that the PV cell temperature in the proposed PV-TEG-microchannel heat-pipe collector without insulation was 6 ◦ C lower than that in the PV-only baseline panel (61.9 ◦ C and 67.9 ◦ C, respectively) after 1 h of opera - tion, and that the electrical efficiency of the proposed hybrid collector without insulation was 12.2%, compared to the 12% of the PV-only panel. The TRL of this type of PV-T collector strongly depends on the specific configuration, with most of the configurations still at a TRL of 6 – 7. Currently, there is one UK manufacturer of vacuum-tube PV-T collectors [92]. 2.4. Dual air – water PV-T collectors Dual air – water PV-T collectors have appeared in an attempt to overcome the limitations of both air- and water-based PV-T collectors. These collectors are designed to operate either heating water (usually in periods of higher ambient temperatures) or heating air (mainly when the ambient temperature is low), depending also on the end-user needs. It is also possible to operate both heat extraction modes either under mild weather conditions or when both hot water and air are needed. Dual air – water PV-T collectors can achieve total efficiencies of about 55% and 70% for air and water heat extraction modes, respectively [73]. Different configurations have been studied [41,48,73], concluding that the best option is to have water channels in thermal contact with the PV cell rear surface and the air heat exchangers below it, also acting as thermal insulation [180], as shown in Fig. 12 [73,181]. Dual air – water PV-T collectors combine the advantages of water- and air-based collectors. To increase the amount of heat extraction using water, the number of water pipes can be increased, which is beneficial for the thermal efficiency but further increases the costs. Cost-effective fins or ribs can be added to the air channel to improve the heat trans - fer coefficient [73]. An experiment was conducted by Ji et al. [182] to investigate the real outdoor performance of a dual air – water PV-T col - lector in different working modes. The thermal efficiencies of the water-heating and air-heating modes at zero reduced temperature reached 44% and 57%, while the electrical efficiency was around 10%. Ma et al. [183] added an additional air-flowing channel with fins above the PV cells. The air flowed through both the channels above and beneath the PV cells. The thermal efficiencies of the water-heating and air-heating modes reached 50% and 55%, respectively, while the elec - trical efficiency was not reported. A noteworthy advantage of dual air – water PV-T collectors arises from their overall versatility, even though they are slightly more com - plex and expensive than typical water-based PV-T collectors. They can take advantage of the dual heat extraction to avoid freezing in cold climates, shifting to heat air when required. These systems can be used in houses, residential and office buildings, mainly for operation at low temperatures, providing a cost-effective solution with a flexible output [41,73]. This type of PV-T collector has a lower TRL of 6 – 7 with no manufacturers of this type of PV-T collector [92]. 2.5. Building-integrated PV-T collectors When PV cells are installed either on the facades or roofs of a building creating the external structure or skin of the building, they are referred to as building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) collectors. BIPV systems are used mainly to produce electricity, but also provide hot air for space heating, which is an added benefit. When the heated air is used to cover part of the building heating load, the system is called a building- integrated PV-T (BIPV-T) system. By simultaneously serving as a building envelope material and a power generator, BIPV-T systems can offer savings in materials and electricity costs, thus reducing the use of fossil fuels and the relevant CO 2 emissions and offering an architectural enhancement to the build - ing. Furthermore, PV panels can be integrated in such a way to provide additional functions like shading, active solar heating and lighting. The advantages of BIPV-T systems are many so they have attracted the in - terest of engineers and architects. In literature, a lot of successful pro - jects are published from around the world. Most of these are applications for residential and commercial buildings. Recently, PV panels are pro - duced as standard building products and a whole new market is created around BIPV-T systems [184]. As a BIPV-T panel is part of a building envelope it must be able to provide weather protection, thermal insu - lation and noise protection [185] and perform these functions without affecting the structural strength or integrity of the building. In addition to the electrical and thermal energy produced, BIPV-T may also allow daylight entry, through semi-transparent modules, thus providing the view of the outside environment so as the building occupants do not feel confined. An added important advantage of BIPV-T systems is that they can function as an attractive architectural element affecting positively the appearance of a building. The idea of transforming buildings from energy users to energy producers is not new. Solutions involving the integration of PV cells into the building envelope appeared almost at the same time as the first PV panels entered the market. The first installation of a BIPV curtain wall façade appeared in Aachen, Germany in 1991 [186]. The need to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and reduce emissions are the main drivers for the continued uptake of BIPV-T products. Most countries promote such systems by funding part of the Fig. 12. Schematic of dual air – water PV-T collector [73,181]. M. Herrando et al.
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 14 installation costs and by providing attractive feed-in tariffs applicable to the use of BIPV products [187]. The present size of the global BIPV market is about 2.3 GW (or ~1% of the global PV market), with Europe constituting the largest market (42% of the global market) in particular due to attractive incentives in France, Italy and Germany [188]. The annual installed capacity of BIPV systems worldwide is expected to reach 32.3 GW by 2024 [189]. BIPV-T systems represent a favourable solution for clean electricity production combined with renewable cooling or heating while reducing the energy demand at the same time. It is estimated that air-based BIPV- T systems have the potential to reduce the primary energy required for heating and cooling from conventional systems by 30% [190], and in preheating applications where the fluid temperature is kept low, such as in combined PV-T-HP systems, the electrical output can be enhanced by 4 – 10% compared to an equivalent non-cooled PV system [191]. They should be applied to buildings usually after other energy-saving mea - sures are taken and they should be economically examined in terms of their lifecycle cost, and not from their initial first cost because the initial expenditure is substantially reduced by the avoidance of the traditional building materials they replace. One important design consideration for BIPV-T systems is whether natural ventilation or mechanical ventilation is used to move the air in the gap between the PV cells and the wall or roof of the building. In the case of solar façades with installed PV panels, the need for ventilated PV cladding is very important, otherwise, due to the high temperature reached by the PV cells, there will be a loss of efficiency and the development of undesirable heat gain to the building, which espe - cially during the summer period could create extra cooling load. Unless provisions are not made to remove the hot air created between the PV cells and the wall of the building, the BIPV panels get warmer than the ones mounted in free air, consequently lowering more their electrical power output. To solve this problem, efficient ways to extract the heat by forced or natural fluid circulation have to be devised. There are a lot of studies trying to optimize the air gap between the PV cells back sur - face and the building element for air circulation, either by forced or natural flow, for cooling the PV arrays. Some studies on naturally ventilated systems are [192 – 201], and on mechanically ventilated sys - tems [202 – 208]. Although the natural convection analysis of the BIPV systems seems complex and inconvenient, it is believed that it has many potentials and is worth better examination due to its advantages [196]. Moreover, various researchers studied the thermal effects in the air gap between the PV cells and the building wall [199,209 – 216] and numerous studies are focussed on the heat transfer analysis between the two skins [190,217 – 220]. PV cells for building integration are usually installed on flat or in - clined roofs, on façades and as shading elements close to windows or even inside window glazing. According to a recent review [221], roof-mounted systems hold 80% of the BIPV market, and façade- - mounted systems account for the rest of the installations. Roof-mounted systems include roof-integrated shingles, skylights, atria and roof panels, and façade-mounted systems include the shading systems, cladding and curtain walls. One possible classification of BIPV-T systems has been provided in a recently published review [222], based on the application, while other studies provide alternative categorizations of BIPV-T systems based on the type of panels and their operation principles [223]. Recently, some authors presented a comparative review of the BIPV systems in selected EU countries, showing that Europe has been the leader in BIPV system development from 2014 to 2020 followed by the USA and Asia [224]. The need to develop more advanced BIPV-T system designs with improved performance has persisted over the years. Architects, engi - neers and users agreed that their preferences for the systems were relevant to the appearance of the systems and their performance. Thus, various design configurations were developed. Some of them are double- skin systems with air passing between the two skins for overheating prevention, transparent and semi-transparent PV panels [225 – 230], roof-integrated PV panels, replacing the conventional roof tiles called PV shingles, façade applications for curtain walls, glazing windows ap - plications, and shading elements applications. Schematics of the most used configurations of BIPV/BIPV-T systems are shown in Fig. 13 as given by Agathokleous and Kalogirou [231]. Fig. 13(a) shows a PV panel in full contact with a building wall. Various studies have examined this design and concluded that it is inefficient due to the overheating of both the PV panels and the building ’ s interior spaces [207,232 – 237]. Fig. 13(b) shows a BIPV system that addresses these problems, by rejecting the heated air, while in Fig. 13(c) a BIPV-T system is shown that uses the heated air for space heating through an air duct in the ceiling. Fig. 13(d), (e), (f) and (g) show roof BIPV and BIPV-T systems; the first one rejects the heated air behind the PV panels and the other three, use the heated air for space heating with ducts or roof air circulation. Fig. 13(h) and (i) show BIPV applications with semi-transparent PV cells which provide indoor natural light as well. Other BIPV applications are the use of BIPV as shading elements and BIPV systems which are also used to provide hot water, connected with pumps and water tanks. Another work studied another configuration of the system named BIPV Trombe wall (BIPV-TW). These systems can provide heating/cooling and generate electricity simultaneously [238]. Another interesting configuration gaining attention recently is the use of PCMs for thermal regulation enhancement of BIPV-T systems [239]. A study where two PCMs were used on the thermal regulation performance of BIPV systems is given by Huang [240] where it is shown that the PV-PCM system with two types of PCM can maintain the PV cells at operating temperature closer to its characteristic value of 25 ◦ C and thus lead to an improvement in solar-to-electrical conversion efficiency under variable diurnal insolation. The most used BIPV-PCM system in the market looks like the schematic representation of Fig. 14, which provides heat transfer enhancement in the interior, with radiation [231]. Various investigators have performed case studies, investigating real-size BIPV and BIPV-T applications or prototypes [241 – 253] and life cycle assessment of BIPV systems [247,254]. A considerable number of researchers have attempted to extend our knowledge of the behaviour of BIPV systems by investigating the flow, heat transfer and optical char - acteristics of the systems [187,255 – 257]. It is known that BIPV systems often reach higher temperatures than standalone systems and this leads to a performance drop. For this reason, accurate thermal modelling of BIPV systems is very important before their installation to evaluate their contribution to the reduction of building energy needs. In this context, several thermal modelling tools have been developed to estimate the operating cell temperatures of PV cells in BIPV systems because they directly affect the performance of the system. Some studies [194,258] investigated the effect of the naturally ventilated air gap of vertical double-skin BIPV systems and provided correlations for the estimation of the convective heat transfer co - efficients for the calculation of the heat transfer rate in the air channel. Friling et al. [206] performed mathematical modelling of the heat transfer dynamics of BIPV systems, showing that the heat transfer rate increases when forced ventilation velocity is increased which was more or less expected. Another study [259] presented the results of a simu - lation study performed in TRNSYS with the use of the existing types of TRNSYS for BIPV and BIPV-T systems considering only a forced venti - lation system. Forced ventilation systems have also been investigated [260,261]. Bigaila et al. [260] performed an experimental study with emphasis on the cell temperature and the air gap heat transfer analysis whereas in another study Rounis et al. [262] investigated the wind ef - fects and fan-induced suction in a multiple-inlet BIPV-T system. There are also various studies on the performance of BIPV systems [225,245,263 – 267], which can be categorized into simulation model - ling, experimental and case studies. The electrical and thermal effi - ciencies of BIPV systems depend on the type of PV used, on the climatic conditions as well as on the configuration of the system, the type of cooling method and the type of integration, among others. A comparison M. Herrando et al.
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 15 between the different configurations in terms of efficiency is difficult to perform due to all these related parameters. Table 5 summarizes the main types of BIPV systems and shows efficiency estimations obtained in previous research. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the size of the air gap, the inclination angle of the collector, the height of the system and the type of PCM are critical parameters for the performance of BIPV systems. It can be generally concluded that BIPV systems with open-ended air channels have better cooling performance and thus higher electrical efficiency than the systems with closed air ducts, and that BIPV systems with PCMs have better thermal performance than the air-based BIPV systems due to the storage ability of the PCMs. Yoo [274] performed a simulation for BIPV shading device optimi - zation through parameter variation, studying the first practical appli - cation of a semi-transparent BIPV system in Korea. The performance of the system was investigated through long-term system monitoring and simulation modelling. Ghani et al. [276] estimated the PV cell conver - sion efficiency of BIPV-T systems using an artificial neural network, while another study [277] investigated the effect of roof configurations Fig. 13. Selected BIPV-T system configurations. Figure from Agathokleous and Kalogirou [231], used with permission from Elsevier. M. Herrando et al.
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 16 on the performance of BIPV systems. An experimental study of a low-cost passive strategy to improve the performance of BIPV systems was undertaken by Yang and Athienitis [278]. A performance evaluation of an air-based BIPV-T system with multiple inlets in a cold climate concluded that no more than four air inlets are needed to provide suf - ficient PV cell cooling [279]. Other investigators performed energy analyses and verification studies of BIPV cells in buildings with building information modelling, and the simulation results were compared to data measured over 3 years [280]. More recently, the performance of a BIPV-T system with PV cells installed at the optimum tilt angle and influenced by shadow was assessed [281], as was the performance of three types of BIPV-TW systems [238]. The influence of a BIPV system on the heating and cooling loads of the building with one-dimensional transient model analysis, for Tianjin, China, was analysed by Wang et al. [282]. A ventilated air gap BIPV system was compared to a non-ventilated system, close roof system and a conventional roof with no PV cells and no air gap. It was concluded that in summer the optimum system is the ventilated air gap which leads to higher conversion efficiency but in winter, the non-ventilated air duct is appropriate. A real system investigation was also done by Aste et al. [283] in the first Italian BIPV project. The system was in operation for 13 years which is representative because it can be considered as about half of the sup - posed lifetime cycle of a PV system. The results obtained show that the PV plant analysed did not present a significant decrease in long-term performance. The measured performance ratio decay was just under 0.4% per year. Azadian and Radzi [284] investigated the optimization assessment of the energy performance of a BIPV-T PCM system using genetic algo - rithms. The overall energy efficiency of the system was evaluated for winter and summer conditions adopting different utilization strategies, and optimized designs were identified. The thermal and electrical effi - ciencies were calculated, and the results showed that such systems can achieve a maximum overall efficiency of 64% in a winter configuration and 32% in a summer configuration. Given the important benefits of BIPV systems, key factors that can influence their performance have been investigated as part of an effort to improve these systems. Such factors include the operating temperature, irradiation conditions, optical losses and changes to the solar spectrum. Additionally, although there is increasing uptake of installations, there are still some important barriers that affect their exploitation such as concerning feed-in tariff implementation, public acceptance and wider government support [231,285,286]. Some authors [272,287] have reported results from investigations in which water-based PV-T collectors were integrated within roofs, giving rise to roof-mounted water-based BIPV-T systems. They concluded that the electrical and thermal performance of these systems is affected by some key design parameters such as the fin efficiency, lamination re - quirements and the thermal conductivity between the PV cells and the supporting structure [287]. The results also showed better cost savings when these units use a natural circulation system, obtaining an esti - mated payback time of around 14 years in warm climate locations [272]. Another study on the effect of flow distribution on the PV cell per - formance in water-based BIPV-T collectors stated that parameters including the manifold-to-riser pipe ratio, array geometry, manifold flow direction and flow rate influence the flow distribution and PV cell efficiency [288]. The authors included several design recommendations for improved performance. More recently, significant energy conversion efficiency improvements to both the electricity generation and heat collection efficiency were reported with water-based BIPV-T collectors [289]. The energy yields of integrated water-based BIPV-T collectors using different façade orientations have been recently investigated [290], with results showing that the largest energy production is ach - ieved on the South façade, while for maximum self-consumption it is recommended to split the BIPV-T collectors among the East, South and West façades. Other investigators analysed and compared the techno-economic performance of uncovered water-based BIPV-T col - lectors: roof-integrated and/or façade integrated vs . standalone PV-T collectors. They developed a model in TRNSYS and analysed the per - formance of the different integration alternatives for DHW, space heating and electricity provision in a multi-storey residential building located in different climates throughout Europe. The results showed simple payback times between 11 and 20 years depending on the climate, with lower payback times in Southern European cities [291]. Fig. 15 shows an application of dual air – water PV-T collectors in a built room, forming a BIPV-T system [292]. The PV-T collector was mounted on the south wall of the room, which can provide passive space heating on cold winter days and hot water during the warm seasons. The working mode can be easily switched between air-heating and water-heating modes in different seasons. On typical summer days, the thermal efficiency reached around 50% and the water tank temperature reached around 40 ◦ C for the water-heating mode. The PV-T collector was Fig. 14.

Herrando et al.
Progress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 17 also able to reduce the cooling load of the room by 2% on summer days. Alternatively, Zhao et al. [147] proposed a refrigerant-based PV-T collector directly integrated into the roof, which acted as the electricity generator and evaporator of an HP. They developed a computer model to analyse the influence of different factors on the system efficiencies and concluded that electrical efficiency remains almost the same under the variation range of evaporation temperatures, while lower evapora - tion temperature leads to higher thermal (and system) efficiencies. 2.6. Concentrated PV-T collectors The difference between a concentrated PV-T (CPV-T) system and a CPV system with active cooling may be ambiguous. The authors take the view that the determination of whether any solar system that includes PV cells (whether concentrated or not) is or is not a PV-T system depends on whether the thermal energyrecovered from this system is utilized for a specific purpose, or rejected to the environment and/or the atmo - sphere. When the thermal energy is delivered as useful thermal output to an end-user in any application, either directly or indirectly via inter - mediate conversion, upgrading or storage, this can be considered a PV- T/CPV-T system, otherwise, it is a PV/CPV system with active (or pas - sive) cooling. CPV-T collectors increase the solar flux incident upon the solar cells, improving both the thermal and electrical outputs of the system, while at the same time the total PV area is reduced and replaced by low-cost reflectors; depending on the relative costs of these two components, this can lead to a reduction in the the system ’ s capital costs (and, thus, payback time) [35,71,73,76]. However, especially when sun tracking is needed, they are more expensive than flat-plate collectors, as this complex mechanism introduces additional costs. Consequently, these systems are normally used when medium to high temperatures are required (usually over 100 – 150 ◦ C), while for lower temperature ap - plications flat-plate collectors appear as a better option [35,73]. CPV-T systems can use lenses or reflectors as concentrators, with lenses being more suitable due to their lower weight and material costs, although they cannot focus scattered light. Therefore, concentrators are normally limited to locations with clear sky weather. Generally, CPV-T systems use liquids (e.g., water, oil, molten salts) rather than air as a coolant because it is more effective, hence obtaining a higher electrical output [35,73]. There are different CPV-T collector types, ranging from stationary flat-plate collectors with added reflectors and low concentrating ratio (solar concentrating ratio < 2.5), to highly concentrating ratio units which require tracking, making roof integration difficult and signifi - cantly increasing maintenance costs [73,76]. Similarly, there are many types of solar tracking options and technologies, and a variety of tracker drive types, which have been reviewed in detail in previous work [293]. In general, CPV-T systems can be grouped into three broad cate - gories: (a) systems with concentration onto a single receiver, where both the PV and thermal receiver are a combined, single unit and under concentrated sunlight; (b) spectrum splitting systems, where the incoming irradiation is split into two components that are delivered to distinct PV and thermal receivers; and (c) systems wherein the PV receiver acts as both a spectral splitter and concentrator. These config - urations are shown schematically in Fig. 16. Fig. 16(a) will result in the highest operating temperature of the PV cells and active cooling is required. In this configuration, achieving high working fluid temperatures results in exceedingly high PV cell temper - atures, reducing cell efficiency. Fig. 16(b) reduces the PV cell working temperature by removing the incident spectrum that the PV cell cannot convert to electricity (or wavelengths of low conversion efficiency). This approach can potentially enable high PV cell efficiency and high thermal receiver working temperatures. Fig. 16(c) is a special case of (b) where the PV receiver acts as both a spectral filter and a concentrator. Such a configuration requires PV receivers with high reflectivity outside of wavelengths of absorption for the PV receiver and can also enable high thermal working temperatures. A significant challenge, however, arises in the comparison of such systems as the design with different levels of concentration, PV cell band-gap, and spectral splitting wavelengths (if used) all drastically impact performance. Additionally, this is further complicated by the design objective of the system, particularly con - cerning the desired operating temperature of the thermal receiver. The two primary metrics for assessing the performance are the overall effi - ciency and the fraction of energy collected from the thermal and PV receivers [294]. The biggest challenge in using the overall efficiency is in quantifying the relative values of the electrical and thermal energy outputs. While many approaches simply add the thermal efficiency to the PV efficiency, this oversimplifies the issue as higher temperatures may be required for a given thermal process. It is possible to assign weighting factors [295] to the thermal energy (although this is assumption driven) or to consider the conversion of all thermal energy to electrical energy (which may not be relevant for heat-driven needs). These metrics are useful for providing insights into the performance bounds of a variety of system configurations and are particularly useful for understanding the upper limits of efficiency, particularly with respect to the PV system [294,296]. Ultimately, this results in difficulty when comparing CPV-T systems, because differing operating tempera - tures, use cases, and designs can lead to significant variations in a defined efficiency. In stationary applications, when the PV-T collectors are installed in a horizontal plane, part of the incoming solar radiation is not used, as it is incident on the horizontal surface free of PV cells which is left to avoid shading. To avoid this effect, some studies [71,73] proposed the installation of booster diffuse reflectors placed between the parallel PV-T collector rows. These reflectors consist of an aluminium sheet and give a nearly uniform distribution of the reflected solar radiation on the PV surface, increasing the solar input by about 50% maximum, which means a concentration ratio of about 1.5 [71]. The results showed that with this configuration it is possible to increase the ele
